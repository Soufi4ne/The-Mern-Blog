      `This is a beginner-friendly guide to using Tailwind CSS, a relatively new but immensely popular and likely game-changing CSS framework. Tailwind adopts a utility-first approach which makes it easy to customize and even easier to maintain as a projects CSS grows in size.`,
      `CSS itself is difficult to manage in large projects and this is further exacerbated by traditional CSS frameworks, like Bootstrap, Foundation, and others which come with a long library of predefined components for common items like buttons, nav bars, footers, and so on. In short, CSS quickly becomes a mess: hard to write, hard to reason about, and even harder to update.`,
      `Tailwind solves many of these challenges by taking a lower-level approach: providing CSS helper classes that can be used to create and customize any design. Its best to see this in action though by giving Tailwind a spin yourself.`,
