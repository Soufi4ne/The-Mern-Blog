            The goal of this project is to create a full website using the MERN Stack : Mongo, Express, React, Node, PLUS TailwindCSS ; to be honest i was not a big fan of CSS frameworks (i used Bootstrap only one time for very small project), but in the current start-up that i work for[a Web Agency], the leav dev forced me to use Tailwind so that my Front Skillz improves. Anyway, i think im gonna make articles about gaming, tech and anime-manga

            I will present myself : My name is Soufi4ne, im a junior Web Developer and also a student at Efrei Paris. Being a good Full Stack Developer is the first goal i want to acheive, and maybe after that i will specialize in something (?), Honestly i dont know what is the most excited part between Front End and Back End... I like both of them ! There is also DevOps that i like a lot and everything related to Cloud Computing ;)

            One of my favorite hobbie is Designing things, i love UX Design using tools like Figma or AdobeXD. I do wireframes, mockup, prototypes and more. If you want to see my creations, i will upload everything in my portfolio (if i manage to finish it one day lol)
